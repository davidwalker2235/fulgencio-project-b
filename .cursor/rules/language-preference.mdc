# Response Language Policy

- Default response language is English for this project.
- Automatically reply in the same language as the user's latest message.
- If the user writes in Spanish, switch to Spanish immediately.
- If the user writes in English, switch to English immediately.
- Keep each response in a single language unless the user explicitly asks for bilingual output.
